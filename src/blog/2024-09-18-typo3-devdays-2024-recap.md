At the beginning of August, it once again was time for the TYPO3 Developer Days
in Karlsruhe. Not my first (actually, my sixth) Developer Days, but I'll share
my experiences here regardless!

Recapping 3 days worth of things is already quite long, so I will not talk about
each session that I attended in detail. Each day includes a list of the ones
I've attendd though.

## Arrival

I started my train journey to Karlsruhe from Rosenheim on the 31st at around 3PM
with two colleagues from in2code, Luis and Florian. Ready to handle anything in
terms of delays,
[after my last train desaster in June](/blog/typo3-cs-2024-q2-recap/) we got
into the train and unexpectedly: Everything went fine.

Of course, in typical DB fashion, our ICE from Munich was not our _actual_ ICE
and rather some replacement service that voided our reservations (but thankfully
also everyone elses) so finding a seat was not a problem at all. After about 4
hours we arrived pretty much on time at 8PM in Karlsruhe, checked in to our
hotel and enjoyed some dinner and drinks at
[KÃ¼hners Wirtshaus](https://kuehners-wirtshaus.eatbu.com/).

## Day 1

I don't think I got in a lot of sleep that night, excitement and anxiety might
have gotten to me a bit, but at about 8:30 in the morning we made our way to the
event venue taking a short stroll through the woods.

After checking in and greeting the first few people on site, it was time for the
event kickoff and Keynote by Benni Mack, asking the important question if CMS'
are still needed with the rampant growth of AI (and yes, they are).

### My session

With the keynote being over, with just a short break, it was time for my very
own session: **Migrating from jQuery - Core Journey to Vanilla JS**. I've been
part of the Core Development team for just above a year, and at some point I
slid into the whole "refactoring jQuery to Vanilla JS" rabbit hole, taking on
large refactorings. I talked about the strategies and tools we employed during
what's already done, and how much is left until jQuery is fully gone from the
TYPO3 Backend.

You can find more information on my talk
[right here](/talks/migrating-from-jquery/), including all links and slide
downloads.

Thanks to everyone who attended my talk and gave me feedback, it's really
appreciated, and I'm glad so many of you enjoyed the insight I gave you!

### Contribution Night

After the sessions concluded for the day, it was time for the ~~Coding~~
Contribution Night! I didn't really came with some specific Core Development
topic prepared or anything, actually something way more interesting.

As a quick recap, I was a participant of the first TYPO3 Surfcamp in April of
this year ([read my recap here](/blog/typo3-surfcamp-2024-recap/)), at which we
grouped in teams and built websites that are supposed to be examples/presets for
one of the key features of TYPO3 v13, **Site Sets**. While we were at the event,
we had development servers that we were able to deploy our changes to, so
non-developers were able to interact with what others have built too.

After the event, these development machines were shut down, which made continued
collaboration a bit harder. We still continued on our project (as finishing a
whole website in 5 days with people you just met is an almost impossible task)
and we needed our designated project manager, Myrna, to review these changes.

So, for this Contribution Night our goal was to get the DDEV setup running on
Myrna's Macbook. And to give a report on that, we managed to do it! It might
sound simple at first, but we had some setup issues, combined with some project
issues that got us into a bit of a stumbling, but we resolved them.

## Day 2

A day full of talks awaited me!

The day started off with my colleague Florians talk on the strategies of the
TYPO3 Marketing team that have been employed over the passing year and things
that are still to come. In an impressive feat, Florian managed to prepare this
talk on a whim after Luisa (his partner in crime for this talk) turned sick at
the start of the week (in case you read this, we all missed you a lot at the
event, Luisa!).

Following up, Jigals talk on the little gems in TYPO3 v13! Suprisingly, the room
was packed full. The pavillon already has a bunch of seating options, but with
the amount of people coming, we basically made an additional row of people
sitting in front of the first-row desks.

Afterwards, it was time for another talk of a colleague, this time Daniel.
Daniel talked about teaching kids programming in elementary school, using LEGO
building kits. He talked about why he started this and the steps involved to
getting it going, as well as how the children participated in the lessons and
were eager to learn and do more and more.

Sebastian Bergmann of PHPUnit fame also was at the event, and equipped with two
talks, I attended the less technical one on Friday, giving a bit of a recap on
PHPUnit history, talking about the things that changed in versions 10 and 11, as
well as giving some insight into the changes coming with version 12.

Oliver Haders talk on securing TYPO3 Web Applications was probably one of my
favorite talks of the event, explaining us the very serious topic of application
security in his humorous ways, including a lot of audience interaction too!

The final talk of the day was Beyond Code by Phindiwe Nqanqaru. She talked about
BabesGotBytes, a non-profit in South Africa, empowering in and teaching girls
and women about tech and programming.

I must say, the addition of the Beyond Horizons category was great, showing us
all those great initiatives on how single people and groups help others to get
to learn and grow in the field of technology and I'd love to hear about even
more different projects at other TYPO3 events in the future.

## Day 3

I overslept...and missed the first two slots of the day. But, final day for me
and time to get in the last few talks before heading home!

My day started with the talk about Responsive Images by Helmut Hummel,
showcasing the new extension
[topimage](https://github.com/helhum/typo3-top-image), which offers a new way of
configuring responsive images declaratively in PHP.

Following up, the talk about making a simpler, more accessible web by Christian
Heilmann. I absolutely share this sentiment (considering my website is simple
and accessible!), and the talk showed the audience all the things they don't
have to build themselves because browsers became incredibly powerful compared to
the olden days of the internet. This also was the first talk that I have seen
that featured live transcription.

Next up was Jochens talk about FrankenPHP. I meet Jochen quite often at
Community Sprints, and I already got a personal presentation of FrankenPHP and
its cool features last year, but I decided to attend the talk to see how it
developed since and what Jochen learned himself over this timespan. And even
while it's not production ready yet, there are some cool prospects with being
able to potentially bundle PHP websites in single executables for easy shipping.

### Talks I attended

- [Responsive Images](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/program/sessions/responsive-images-817)
- [Let's make a simpler, more accessible web](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/program/sessions/lets-make-a-simpler-more-accessible-web-819)
- [FrankenPHP - A modern Webserver to spice up your PHP App](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/program/sessions/frankenphp-a-modern-webserver-to-spice-up-your-php-app-771)
- [The Secret Way to Success as a TYPO3 Developer](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/program/sessions/the-secret-way-to-success-as-a-typo3-developer-800)

### Verdict

The Developer Days were as awesome as always! The talks were varied and there
were many interesting topics, I especially enjoyed the non-TYPO3 "Beyond
Horizons" category, giving us insight into more societal topics outside of our
sphere.

My favorite talks this event were:

- [Let's make a simpler, more accessible web](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/program/sessions/lets-make-a-simpler-more-accessible-web-819)
- [State of CSS 2024](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/program/sessions/state-of-css-2024-809)
- [Securing TYPO3 Web Applications](https://t3dd24.typo3.com/program/sessions/securing-typo3-web-applications-811)

All-in-all an event I can always recommend to anyone old and new in the TYPO3
space. If you want to learn new things about TYPO3 and the web the DevDays are
the right place for that! Can't wait for next year already, where the event will
take place in Karlsruhe again on **7th to 9th August 2025**!

_I swear I'm not late with this, I forgot I had this post sit in my drafts for
over a month..._
