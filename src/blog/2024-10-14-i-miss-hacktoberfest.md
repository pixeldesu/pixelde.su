_At least the ones before 2020._

I like contributing to open-source software, so much so that I do it mostly in
my free time. Having a month that was somewhat dedicated to motivating more
people into contributing, with the bonus of getting a shirt with a cool motive
on it, was pretty rad.

I even went ahead and told people about Hacktoberfest, who had projects
struggling with low contributions, to market themselves with low-barrier
documentation contributions and similar that would maybe spark more regular
contributors, especially because the community around said projects wasn't
small, just the motivation was low. Throwing a shirt in the mix surely got some
people to do that one PR they dreaded before.

Now it's October again, and I'm here, and I feel like making OSS contributions
to some projects. Hacktoberfest is still going strong, but it isn't like before
anymore. And it's not about the fact that we don't receive a shirt anymore.
While it's a bit weird, a virtual pinboard can still be a motivating factor,
[I do have mine, for example](https://www.holopin.io/@pixeldesu).

For the people that don't know, Hacktoberfest initially started out being able
to contribute towards **any** GitHub repository. This, however, changed in 2020,
after a programming YouTuber made a video titled **"How to Earn Free T-Shirt,
Swag & Goodies Online"**, basically detailing how to make low-quality PRs to
fill up the count of required pull requests quickly.

The year was bad enough to taint Hacktoberfest for many open-source maintainers
due to the massive spam they received.

Just 3 days after Hacktoberfest 2020 started
[it was made opt-in for projects](https://twitter.com/hacktoberfest/status/1312221208667185153).
This new system helped combat the massive spam waves relatively quickly with
projects now needing the `hacktoberfest` topic to have PRs count towards a
user's total.

My main problem now is that **I can't contribute to the projects I want to** to
make my contributions count.

This kind of goes against the spirit of the whole thing since the main factor
should be the contributions themselves, not the reward. But why would I partake
in Hacktoberfest if I can't contribute to the projects that I'm actively using
to get my count worth for the 4 PRs?

**Couldn't you ask a maintainer to add the tag when you contribute?** Of course
you can, but that'd be awkward. Instead of passively gaining your PR count with
contributions, it makes you look like you contribute for the sake of getting the
shirt/badges/whatever.

In hindsight, I think the spam stuff was inevitable. If it wasn't for that one
YouTuber making that video, someone would have written a blog post or found
another loophole around the whole thing to break it, possibly even worse.

The current Hacktoberfest doesn't feel natural anymore. Of course, someone can
be a good Samaritan and contribute to the projects in need with the
Hacktoberfest label, but would you do that if you have no contact point? People
tend to (and should) contribute to the projects they use, not contribute
randomly to boost their profiles and CVs to bolster how good of a dev they are.

Maybe we need to look past Hacktoberfest and let it go. _I'll probably make my
contributions this month and then write a blog post at the end of the month to
accommodate my achievements..._

That sounds like a plan!
