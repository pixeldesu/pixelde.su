_One year ago, after some consideration, I decided to switch to Apple Music,
away from Spotify. I'll discuss my experience and thoughts on Apple Music in
this post!_

## Why switch away from Spotify?

There are a multitude of reasons. Most people already know the awful pay, etc.,
but that was not even the final straw for me because if I really want to support
an artist, I buy their music elsewhere, like physically or on Bandcamp. That's
what I still do to this day.

I use streaming services for their convenience of being portable (I don't have
to carry my hundreds of gigabytes collection with me), and I also like the
algorithmic playlists, which sometimes get me to discover new artists or artists
I haven't heard of before. That's why Spotify has become annoying in recent
years.

In the middle of 2023, I started getting a lot of unrelated artists in my
**Discover Weekly** and **Release Radar** playlists, things that were placed
really high because Spotify thought they matched my tastes. So what happened?
Some weird Cloud rapper based some really awful tracks on top of the Evangelion
soundtrack and always included Shiro Sagisu as an artist. As I listened to a lot
of Evangelion OST then, Spotify assumed that I was interested in that feature of
Shiro.

For some reason, it's always terrible rappers that do this. Another case where
this happened is when some other artists made tracks, including **Hatsune
Miku**, **Supercell**, **goreshit** (_which is veeery specific_), and more in
the artist credits, 16 in total. And because I listen to most of those, it was a
top track recommended for me.

No matter how often you tell Spotify you dislike that type of music, new
strategies to fool the algorithm come around. And as the recommendations became
more and more unusable, I thought about just switching platforms. Most artists
just use distribution services to get their music on any streaming platform. So,
as I'm already deep in that ecosystem, my sights fell on **Apple Music**.

## The music selection

As mentioned above, for the most part, this is the same as on every platform.
That said, in some cases, especially really old releases, Apple Music tends to
have some more music available. A good example of this is **This Binary
Universe** by **BT**, which I could never listen to on Spotify (however, that
might have changed because there was a re-release of the album, which probably
also landed on Spotify).

Additionally, you can access the iTunes Store catalog through Apple Music if you
fancy buying older releases (and I still own some from my iPod days).

I also love the feature that anything I include in Apple Music, including local
music, gets automatically synced to every other device. I have learned that
Spotify also somewhat supports this, but when I tried to open my local music
collection with Spotify, I only remember it slowing down to a crawl or crashing
entirely.

Regarding suggestions for new artists and the variety of algorithmic playlists,
Apple Music has the basics and some additional things. Still, it does not go as
far as Spotify (which is also acceptable).

## Clients

Getting everything started on my phone was easy as pie since Apple Music is
integrated into the regular music player. On the desktop, I was a bit scared as
I heard the wildest stories regarding Apple Music's state on Mac, among other
things.

When I installed Apple Music on my Windows machine, I was surprised to see that
it is built using WinRT/UWP, which makes it a native app. Of course, many views
are still backed by web functionality, but it's not an all-out web frame. This
is even funnier to me, considering some newer Windows apps, like Teams, are just
Electron apps. So, you have a competitor making native apps on your own
platform.

However, I quickly switched away from Apple Music due to one thing missing that
I like to use: Scrobbling to last.fm. No practical use aside from "number goes
up," but I like looking back on what I listened to. I quickly stumbled upon
[Cider](https://cider.sh/), an alternative client built by a group supporting
the platform with various additional things (and also available on Mac/Linux).
Contrary to the official app, this one is backed by Electron, but the
performance is good and has many nifty features.

# Features

Additionally, Apple Music has some extra features that I find nifty but don't
really are necessities of day-to-day use:

- The lyrics are integrated nicely (both in Apple Music and Cider). However,
  Spotify has increasingly tried to eliminate them in recent years.
- The karaoke feature that removes sung lyrics from songs is quite impressive! I
  don't sing along to songs, but on a technical level, it at least is.
- **Music Haptics** is also a fun feature, just without use for myself.

_I'm satisfied with the service and'll stick with it. If anything changes, I'll
mention that here (or on social media)!_
