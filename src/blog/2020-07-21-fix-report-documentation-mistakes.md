So, I've been in the web development space for around 6-7 years now, and in the
more recent years I've also taken a knack at writing documentation, for mine as
well as for other projects.

Something I noticed in spaces of bigger OSS project communities is that a lot of
people complain a lot about documentation...and don't fix it.

People that complain either know that the documentation is wrong, or ran into an
issue with the code snippet/guide presented.

If you managed to fix the problem in your project, you know what's there to
adjust!

Now, there's multiple approaches to take here:

- If you already have some experience contributing to projects, find the
  repository with your conflicting piece of documentation and **open a Pull
  Request**!
- Don't feel comfortable contributing to the project yourself? **Open an issue**
  detailing your problem! If it's not someone of the project's contributors,
  maybe someone else will pick up the task and adjust the documentation.

As an example for this, I found (really) outdated documentation on implementing
Babel with Rollup. _Granted, I already knew of the newer packages, but so I
decided to give the documentation a small makeover. Even with the review
feedback I spent less than 15 minutes overall on this._

[babel/website #2298: Update Rollup usage/setup guide](https://github.com/babel/website/pull/2298)

The time you spent finding a proper solution has probably been way longer than
the time you need to spend for both of the above points, so...help out your
fellow developers before they end up stumbling over the same mistakes as you
did. Not just them, but also the maintainers will thank you for it!
