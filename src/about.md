<p>My name is Andy, and I'm a <span class="js-age">28</span> year old Senior Frontend Developer from southern Germany.</p>

<p>I love building and contributing to open source software, some of which you can find on the <a href="/projects">Projects page</a> on this website. Besides that, I also love taking apart anything that I come across. Learning how things are built and what other secrets they might contain is really interesting to me.</p>
</div>

This also plays into my other hobby of game/tech preservation. Seeing some
online games becoming unplayable because they are deemed unprofitable or other
things is sad, so I have taken it upon myself to help out keeping at least some
of them alive. My primary focus for myself is Pangya, an MMO golf game I played
a lot in my childhood.

## Gaming

While adulthood definitely caught up to me and I don't play as much as I did
before, gaming still plays a role in my life! My favorite genres of games are
**Visual Novels**, **Rhythm Games** and **Roguelikes**. Some of my favorite
games at the moment:

- **DJMAX Respect V**
- **Risk of Rain 2**
- **Tetris Effect**

## Music

Music is a large part of my life and there are practically only very few moments
when I don't listen to something. My taste is quite varied, but I'm definitely
more into **Electronic** music, mostly of the faster variety. I have too many
favorite artists, so I'll list off some of my favorite (net)labels instead:

- **Hardcore TANO*C**
- **Diverse System**
- **Unitone**

## Anime / Manga

You can see hints of japanese media across the previous sections already, so
it's not too suprising that I also read manga and watch anime. I don't really
have any favorite genre, I'll occassionally check out what people recommend and
sometimes that sticks with me! Here's a small selection of favorites:

- **Neon Genesis Evangelion** (preferably the movies over the anime, though)
- **The Tatami Galaxy**
- **Mawaru Penguindrum**
