# What I'm doing now

This is my [now](https://nownownow.com) page, giving an overview of the things I
am doing currently.

## What I'm working on

- A lot of [Retrospring](https://github.com/Retrospring/retrospring) stuff,
  mostly fixing up legacy bugs and adding new features.
- I'm removing all usages of jQuery from the [TYPO3](https://typo3.org) backend
  JS code.

## What I'm playing

- [Rabbit and Steel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2132850/Rabbit_and_Steel/)
- [vivid/stasis](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2093940/vividstasis/)

## What I'm watching

- [HUNTERÃ—HUNTER](https://anilist.co/anime/11061/HUNTERHUNTER-2011/)

## What I'm listening to

- I'm not too much on _faster music_ at the moment, I'm listening to a bunch of
  (progressive) house and trance music, usually from following labels
  - [Diverse System](https://diverse.jp/) (the **AD:TRANCE** and
    **AD:Progressive House** albums)
  - [Unitone](https://unitone.fm/) (the **Unitone PHASE** albums)
