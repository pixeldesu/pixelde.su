## Software

### Browser

- I'm a web developer by trade, so technically I use every browser, but
  generally my main browser by now is [Arc](https://arc.net/).
- To block unwanted content while browsing, I use
  [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) and
  [uBlacklist](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist). Additionally for YouTube,
  I use [SponsorBlock](https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock) as well.
- If I can't contribute improvements to websites, I tend to heavily modify my
  browsing experience with [userstyles](https://github.com/pixeldesu/userstyles)
  and [userscripts](https://github.com/pixeldesu/userscripts). For that I use
  [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/) and
  [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) respectively.

### Editors / Terminals

- For more specific projects that require better language tooling, I use
  [JetBrains IDEs](https://jetbrains.com) like **PhpStorm**, **RubyMine** or
  **Rider**.
- As a regular editor for all kinds of files I use
  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
- My preferred color scheme is
  [Ayu Mirage](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-colors) and my font of choice
  usually is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

### Reverse Engineering

- My go-to decompiler and disassembler is [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja).
- For .NET specific schenanigans I use
  [dnSpy](https://github.com/dnSpyEx/dnSpy).
- Looking into file formats, I use different variations of Hex Editor plugins
  for VS Code, [010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) or
  [ImHex](https://imhex.werwolv.net/).
- I document most of my file format discoveries using
  [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/).
