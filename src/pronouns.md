Here's my pronouns:

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore-start -->
<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-3 text-center my-3">
  {{ comp ui.flatCard }}<p class="leading-none font-bold text-3xl text-sky-500 m-0 mb-0">he/him</p>
    <p class="leading-none font-semibold m-0 mt-2">English</p>{{ /comp }}
  {{ comp ui.flatCard }}<p class="leading-none font-bold text-3xl text-sky-500 m-0 mb-0">er/ihn</p>
    <p class="leading-none font-semibold m-0 mt-2">German</p>{{ /comp }}
</div>
<!-- deno-fmt-ignore-end -->

I'm also fine if people use **they/them** for me, either if they do not know or
just speak out of habit in general.

In terms of names with which you can address me, the following are fine, I don't
have a specific preference for either so use the one that is in your mind and
rolls off your tongue the easiest:

- **Andreas**
- **Andy** (and the german **Andi** is good too)

If you want to address me using my nickname, this works:

- **pixeldesu**
- **pixel**

I prefer my nickname to be written in _**all lowercase**_, mainly because I
think that **Pixeldesu** looks ugly typographically. If you just call me
**Pixel**, the uppercase variant is fine.
