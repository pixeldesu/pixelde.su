After Elon Musk bought Twitter, it went downhill rapidly. This talk mentions some of the "best moments" since then and talks about some of the alternatives that exist, like Bluesky and the Fediverse.

The fediverse is further elaborated on, explaining the concept and protocol behind it, giving a basic introduction and also delving into the possibilities of it, like implementation into websites that themselves aren't social networks.
