With TYPO3 v12 coming up and me already having delved into it quite a bit, I decided to give a talk on CKEditor 5 and how to write plugins for it at T3BOARD. 

I worked a lot with plugins before because I internally had to rewrite a plugin for the Lux TYPO3 extension from CKEditor 4 to 5, and was massively frustrated by the complexity I encountered.

This talk gave some insights into the complex structure and showcased how to overcome some problems using provided code examples.
