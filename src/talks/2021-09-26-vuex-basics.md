This talk was requested by one of the participants of TYPO3camp Munich, asking for an introduction into [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), the state management library used in combination with the [Vue frontend framework](https://vuejs.org/).

I agreed on doing the introduction and prepared a simple example project, showcasing the different parts that make up Vuex:
* State
* Getters
* Mutations
* Actions

After the initial explainer, I received some questions from the participant and answered them _on stage_.
