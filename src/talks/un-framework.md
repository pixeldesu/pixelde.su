In the age of modern frontend frameworks like React and Vue that often require a lot of additional backend work to deliver dynamic content, there has been a renaissance of delivering HTML again, with a twist. 

With some specialized requests and HTML tags, the Hotwire suite of libraries enables dynamic adjusting of page contents with no to minimal JavaScript. 

In this talk, I'll walk through the basics, show some examples and present use cases how Hotwire/Turbo can be combined with TYPO3.
