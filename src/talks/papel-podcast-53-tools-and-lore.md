I built a set of reverse engineering tooling around the game Pangya, which is also released on GitHub at [retreev/PangLib](https://github.com/retreev/PangLib). I talk about some discoveries I made, including the lore of Pangya which I extracted from the game data of the PSP script files and the ongoing effort to make sense of the story across the games and spin-offs.
