Consent Management for cookies has been the craze for the past two years and
there's still the need for nicely integrated solutions, especially in TYPO3.

Different members of the community showcased their solutions, including myself
for my employer. Out of all shown projects, ours was the only one that was
CMS-agnostic (because it's not dependent on a CMS at all).

I also showcased an internal tool I built based on Puppeteer that allows to
crawl websites for cookies and local storage entries to be added to consent
management tools.
