## JavaScript

This site uses minimal JavaScript, the main two elements _optionally_ requiring
it are the navigation on mobile devices and the webring widget on the front page
of the site. Both include checks if JavaScript is disabled and try to provide an
alternative experience without it:

- The mobile navigation is always open without JavaScript
- The webring widget doesn't show a random Webring at the top and only is a
  collapsed list instead

## Accessibility

Accessibility is a high priority on this website. I regularly test features
myself (and using tools like [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)) and aim to make
this website accessible to as many people as possible.

If there are any problems with navigating around this website, feel free to
[reach out to me](/contact).
